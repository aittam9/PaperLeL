20,85,There is a lot to learn about Chernobyl.
21,87,There are a wealth of references on Chernobyl.
22,89,These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called Chernobyl:
23,118,As a child in the 50's I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy (primitive at best!) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging--they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments....

27,135,"Musharraf held elections in October of 2002, in which center-right parties did well, but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition, MMA."
28,145,Al-Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf's lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow.

34,164,George W. Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president.
35,165,"The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000, so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard."
36,167,' Bush fails reporter's pop quiz on international leaders
37,172,"The front-runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller, a political reporter for WHDH-TV in Boston."
38,174,"Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, India and Pakistan."
39,178,"Hiller asked, inquiring about Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who seized control of the country October 12."
40,179,"""Wait, wait, is this 50 questions?"" asked Bush."

44,187,"""It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments,"" said David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council."
45,188,"Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was, he seems to have confused coup-making with ""taking office,"" and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military, then the world's strongest supporter of the Taliban, would bring ""stability!"""
46,200,Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then.

52,248,THE DAILY STAR publishes this commentary in agreement with Agence Global
53,249,Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process
54,250,But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo-Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making.
55,257,And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga's four-day visit to India recently.
56,258,"According to Professor S D Muni, South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University, the two-year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are stalemated."
57,259,"For that reason, he said, Kumaratunga's government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support."
58,261,"And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive,"" Muni told IPS."
59,262,Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003.
60,264,Kumaratunga's India tour preceded a three-day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002.
61,265,"Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success, and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed-door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track, diplomatic sources said."
62,268,"According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat, the difficulty for Kumaratunga's government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control."
63,269,A veteran of India's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment.
64,270,"Kalkat, who currently chairs the independent US-based International Council on Conflict Resolution, said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers, India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks."
65,271,"""The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [unlike India] to underwrite any arrangement,"" Kalkat told IPS in an interview."
66,273,"Under the accord, a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east."
67,275,"About 1,200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict."
68,276,"India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa, a strong critic of Indian mediation."
69,277,"Last June, an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US$4.5 billion."
70,279,"He complained about the ""visible lack of progress"" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides."
71,281,But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo-Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making.
72,284,"She added that recent visits to the island by India's top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have ""caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island""."
73,285,"But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill-advised to be involved again, militarily, with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka's Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits."
74,293,Musharraf calls the bluff
75,298,The reality is that India is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan.
76,300,"Realists, and this even includes members of the U.S. Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott, who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia, understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo."
77,303,"Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet, under Colin Powell (who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics), the pendulum of U.S. policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India."
78,317,"Despite many wrinkles, India remains a part-democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent Kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op-ed piece against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly."
79,319,"The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China, hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea."
80,329,We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam.
81,332,"During his time in the Guard, George Bush flew the F-102 Delta Dagger fighter-interceptor."
82,333,The F-102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969.
83,334,"During this time, F-102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut, Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam, and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand."
84,342,What follows is the text of an e-mail sent to me by a friend of mine (thanks to Dave Manzano).
85,353,The future president joined the Guard in May 1968.
86,363,"After training, Bush kept flying, racking up hundreds of hours in F-102 jets."
87,365,"At the time, guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation."
88,366,"According to records released earlier this year, Bush earned 253 points in his first year, May 1968 to May 1969 (since he joined in May 1968, his service thereafter was measured on a May-to-May basis)."
89,367,Bush earned 340 points in 1969-1970.
90,368,"[In other words, Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969-1970 alone."
91,370,He earned 137 points in 1970-1971.
92,371,And he earned 112 points in 1971-1972.
93,372,"The numbers indicate that in his first four years, Bush not only showed up, he showed up a lot."
94,374,"That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “deserted” (according to anti-Bush filmmaker Michael Moore) or went “AWOL” (according to Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee)."
95,375,Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign.
96,376,His superior officers said OK.
97,377,"Requests like that weren’t unusual, says retired Col. William Campenni, who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971."
98,378,"“In 1972, there was an enormous glut of pilots,” Campenni says."
99,383,"From May 1972 to May 1973, he earned just 56 points — not much, but enough to meet his requirement."
100,385,"In June and July of 1973, he accumulated 56 points, enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973-1974 year."
101,389,"During his service, Bush received high marks as a pilot."
102,390,A 1970 evaluation said Bush “clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot” and was “a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership.”
103,391,A 1971 evaluation called Bush “an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot” who “continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further.”
104,392,And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer.”
105,397,"The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans’ attack, but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons."

108,409,"There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope, one they have been awaiting all their lives, but at the same time, many others are already dreading it."
109,415,"Sheikh Naji Al-Abbudi, a spokesman for Sistani, affirmed the claims that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list."
110,417,"Al-Abbudi stated that ""His Emminence"" decided to openly support the list because ""others"" (obviously a reference to Allawi) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning."
111,429,The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq.
112,432,"Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks, others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party."
113,434,"I had an interesting conversation with a middle-aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya, Baghdad."
114,436,He described Allawi's face as that of a f*ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors.
115,438,He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution.
116,440,Sunni Iraqis contend that elections are impossible to hold under occupation.
117,444,He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments.

119,454,"The Al-Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al-Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid-nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al-Dulaymi, an Air Force general belonging to their tribe."

121,465,I thought the US government was looking for me.
122,478,"They happened in the Philippines which, like Pakistan, is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other."
123,480,"The bombings implicated Muslims, and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit."
124,484,"I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela, which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes."
125,485,"I expect it will be determined that, under ""Strong Man"" Hugo Chavez, Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial."
126,492,"His case threatens the consensus fiction of the ""War on Terror."""
127,494,"Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling- dating from the 1980s- is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot, by Jack Terrell."
128,495,"Terrell, a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort, identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North..."
129,496,I seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives.
130,499,Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell's whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics.
131,502,They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson.
132,507,"Third ranking CIA officer, Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd, 1983, that on November 8th, 1982, he had authorized a search of CIA records ""for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P. Wilson, or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th, 1971, when he retired from the CIA."""

146,571,The drugs and arms travel in all directions.
147,575,"A recent report by a journalist from Port Blair, in the Andamans, quoted an unnamed official saying that foreigners from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands, using fake Indian ration cards, while citizens of Thailand, China, Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural resources and leave."

150,580,"The presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns, cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous."

188,684,Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream.
189,691,Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan’s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai’s campaign against warlords.
190,692,"At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran’s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo-conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively, the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post, spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran."

340,1326,"Its so-called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the ""good-cop versus bad-cop"" game."
341,1327,"Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism, it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq, it is fully funding the Hezbollah and, through it, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium, which includes, as minor players, Syria, Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq."

418,1527,The purpose of the letter bombs -- which resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a message.
419,1529,There was no claim of responsibility.

505,2113,"With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities."

510,2154,I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in front of people they will modulate their approach.

664,3378,There was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value.
665,3382,I believe that there might be a sign-flipping problem for PUTS that 's causing this whole issue.
666,3396,Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis (and assume everything will work out at month end)?
667,3401,There was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value.

681,3541,Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.

689,3627,I communicated that to Bob Bowen.
690,3644,This amendment adds the British Columbia Securities Act representation to the master.
691,3677,"The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( see attached email ) was to provide a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand and location a timely substantiation of stock on balance sheet forward MTM debtors and creditor balances OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany account"
692,3686,A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400.

696,3763,"I understand that it is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, extrcurricular activities, etc., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate my disability."
697,3770,I know that with my industry-wide and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund.
698,3785,I want to make sure that I understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value would be booked.

700,3805,"Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) with ECS obligates ECS to ""work in good faith with CDEC"" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system."
701,3808,"In the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs."
702,3812,"That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution."
703,3818,My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak load periods.
704,3823,"They are deemed to be on notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and alternates, they could have done so."
705,3824,"None of them did, and most importantly, the winning bidders did not."
706,3829,"My concern with adding the language below is, could it be argued that not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since we just stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different rate??"
707,3832,After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other negotiated rate agreements we've done.
708,3836,"In discussion with Dave, we thought it would be good to put this together in a format of questions and answers."

723,3963,There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th.
724,3964,The forum is expected to be invited testimony only.
725,3966,The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom.
726,3977,Enron needs to use this situation to quickly get our viewpoints up into the PUCT and ERCOT ISO on what is driving these problems and our proposed fixes.
727,3981,"Jean and Thane, I think that we need a FORMAL PLAN on what to do over the next 3 - 6 months to leverage this situation."
728,3989,"We envision a format that would provide a brief summary and analysis of the order, filing, etc. with a link to the source document as well for those who would like more detailed information."

739,4139,"Stephanie, I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like ""Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."" or ""Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division""."
740,4144,There's a new EOL Counterparty listed in the UK.
741,4165,"F.O.B. refers to the following terms: Seller is responsible for freight, unloading and storage up to and including delivery in warehouse, Buyer is responsible for storage, loading and freight after delivery."
742,4171,"The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency."
743,4192,"We informed Tana that we made the change in Global Counterparty to include, ""a division of Cargill Incorporated""."
744,4197,The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.
745,4201,My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed.
746,4218,GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the Tradename / Division name or Parent Name -- not both simultaneously.
747,4220,This defeats the purpose of using a Tradename.
748,4234,"Stephanie, I my preference is to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read something like ""Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."" or ""Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division""."
749,4239,There's a new EOL Counterparty listed in the UK.

757,4356,I have a copy of the document I can give to you tomorrow.
758,4362,"John, Per and I discussed the hostile environment issue and we are both concerned that we may have some repercussions."
759,4370,I wanted to let you know about this before I respond to her request.
760,4374,"Kathy McMahon suggested that I contact you in an effort to gather information on: Enron's Affirmative Action Policy and plans; as well as demographic analysis of workforce (gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality)"
761,4390,"We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to picket the Lake Worth, Florida project as well."
762,4391,Our execution team needs to get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with the progress of the work.
763,4392,"In that respect, we need to dial in Rick Johnson and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team."
764,4393,"I think the first step is a call between yourself, me, Mark Stubley and Mike Indivero."
765,4402,"Mike Indivero, I understand that Mr. Mike Croall's release date from NEPCO is Oct 31, 2001."
766,4411,I assume we should come over EB.

773,4500,He faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight.
774,4504,Joe asked that you fax the revised gtee wording that has been agreed (I believe it was our agreeing to reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5) and the new l/c wording (drops the 2 day period to replace an l/c with a different bank if the first refuses to pay).
775,4505,"I know we talked about these issues earlier, but Tiger's lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be issued for signing, even if we are the one's issuing the gtee and l/c."
776,4508,There is an outside chance we could have everything set to go this week.
777,4522,"As for me, well, I lead the simple life, own a little house in West University, own a little car (I had to buy a new one recently - the 14-year old 380 SE started scaring me a bit), you know, the usual."

785,4592,"The attached documents include the GA II Settlement proposal, an Attachment (a copy of PG&E's proposed Gas Rule 27), and a set of supporting workpapers."
786,4596,"In the meantime, we extend our best wishes for a safe and happy holiday season."
787,4600,This is to inform that a representative of Enron Corp would like to address the Commission on the issue of utility rate stabilization plans at the Commission's hearings scheduled for December 27th and 28th.

793,4644,"His press release following the hearing renewed the call for ""refunds."""
794,4645,"On my panel, Loretta Lynch asked Reliant and Duke to supply her with the details of the contracts they cut to sell their power forward to marketers."
795,4648,"Bilbray joined the ""gouging"" band wagon."
796,4650,"On the positive side, the FERC commissioners lauded Wolak, his analysis, and his remarks on the panel."
797,4654,"In the best case, the clamoring for a ""refund"" subsides."
798,4656,"In the medium case, investigations find that Enron (like others) ""played by the rules,"" but the rules stunk, and Enron profited at the expense of California consumers."
799,4700,"The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1Q 2003."
800,4701,Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur.
801,4702,Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore.
802,4707,"Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels."
803,4733,Attached is my resume.
804,4734,I highlight the relevant skills in the summary.
805,4736,"It was posted on Dec. 11, but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on the internet, it is open."
806,4742,That girl's mother sounds like a real problem.
807,4753,"On top of things, I had quiz at 8am."

830,4993,"The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use, I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates."
831,5003,The new TW Hotline was implemented Monday which included customer notification in the form of a Popup message in TMS and a Critical Notice which sent an Email.
832,5010,"The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use, I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates."
833,5026,Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report.
834,5081,"My concern is that between now and then Dunn, the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators/marketers' claims."
835,5086,"I apologize, I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be."
836,5103,A state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices.
837,5105,"Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers."
838,5106,"The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge."
839,5107,"Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show."
840,5108,"""I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort,"" said Dunn."
841,5110,"Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt ""betrayed"" by the actions of Winter."
842,5111,"""The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis,"" Maviglio said."
843,5112,"Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office."
844,5113,ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct.
845,5114,The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on.
846,5116,"""It was an emergency,"" Fishman said."
847,5117,"""We had to take action.''"
848,5120,"""They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much,"" said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March."
849,5122,"Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed."
850,5123,"The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators."
851,5124,"""If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III."
852,5126,"He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to ""fix"" prices, which would violate federal trade laws."
853,5127,"In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market."
854,5128,The generators got their way.
855,5129,"The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan."
856,5132,"They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted."
857,5133,What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis.
858,5135,Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government.
859,5139,"""In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said."
860,5141,"""The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said."
861,5143,"This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business."""
862,5144,"Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show."
863,5145,Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion.
864,5146,Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians.
865,5149,Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials.
866,5150,"""We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said."
867,5152,"We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund."""
868,5153,"Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap."
869,5155,"""Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers."
870,5156,"""He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing."""
871,5158,"Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said."
872,5159,"James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter."
873,5160,"""They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said."
874,5161,"""They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do."""
875,5163,He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues.
876,5164,"""We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out,"" Dunn said."
877,5165,"""Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''"
878,5171,My take is that the UDCs will be indifferent to this (maybe?) and our #1 priority is to work to get the PG&E model adopted across the state.
879,5175,"I suggest a ""blind draw"" on the teams, best ball not scramble on the golf, and as for the wager, no emails from the losing team for one week!"
880,5188,"There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation, but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show."

1100,6331,"Over time, the wolf's absence seemed to rehabilitate its image."
1101,6338,"They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams, a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion."

1115,6367,"A Yellowstone wolf was found dead, hit by a car, on a Colorado highway last year, several hundred miles from home."
1116,6369,"There are only about 850 wolves in the West, but there are an estimated 31,000 mountain lions."
1117,6370,"Pound for pound, mountain lions eat more game and more livestock than wolves."
1118,6372,"Yet people seem willing -- even eager -- to accommodate mountain lions, despite the risks."
1119,6375,They seem to be just that: rumors.
1120,6378,"Bangs said these animals are not equipped to survive in the wild, however, and they all almost certainly have died."
1121,6379,"He said after 10 years of DNA testing on northern Rockies wolves, scientists have not found a single strain that did not belong to one of the wolves the agency released -- or their descendants."

1123,6390,"Nina Leopold Bradley, a plant ecologist and daughter of the conservation pioneer Aldo Leopold, published a 1999 paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on her 61-year uninterrupted phenological records."
1124,6391,Phenology studies an organism's development and life cycle -- the pulse of life.
1125,6392,"Bradley's record of 300 phenophases found that even prior to 1999, spring was arriving in higher latitudes several weeks earlier than in the earlier years of her data."
1126,6396,Half of the 300 phenophases Leopold tracked showed a response consistent with warming.
1127,6398,An analysis of 65 bird species in the United Kingdom shows about one-third are laying their eggs four to seven days earlier than they did 25 years ago.
1128,6399,"""One of the major, most well-documented and robust findings in ecology over the past century has been the crucial role of climate in determining the geographical distribution of species and ecological communities,"" concluded a report titled ""Observed Impacts of Global Climate Change in the United States,"" released by the Pew Center on Global Climate last week."
1129,6400,Pew researchers looked at about 40 studies that could provide an assessment of whether climate was affecting biology.
1130,6401,"""Half of the studies provide strong evidence of a causal link between the biological change and climate change,"" said Camille Parmesan, a University of Texas-Austin biologist and one of the world's leading experts on this issue."
1131,6402,"These changes are occurring across all species, Parmesan told UPI's Climate."
1132,6403,"""Across the United States, the northern edge of species' range is expanding,"" she said."
1133,6406,"""Empirical research pointed to climate as being a strong driver,"" she said."
1134,6409,"Throughout the United States, she said, ""spring is about two weeks earlier."
1135,6414,"Such consequences include shifting and, in some cases, contraction of ranges and changes in species composition within ecosystems."
1136,6417,"The Pew report coincided with the release in Iceland of the ""Arctic Climate Impact Assessment."""
1137,6418,"The ACIA -- with participation by the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation and Sweden -- was begun in 2000."
1138,6419,"""The impacts of global warming are affecting people now in the Arctic,"" said ACIA chair Robert Corell."
1139,6421,"The impacts of climate change on the region and the globe are projected to increase substantially in the years to come."""
1140,6422,The ACIA found Arctic winter temperatures have increased 4 degrees to 7 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years and should go up about twice that much in the next 100 years.
1141,6424,"""Should the Arctic Ocean become ice-free in summer, it is likely that polar bears and some seal species would be driven toward extinction,"" the report concluded."
1142,6425,"As with so much climate research, not everyone agrees with these dire predictions."
1143,6426,"A third report, ""The Impacts of Climate Change: An Appraisal for the Future,"" completed by the Britain-based International Policy Network and released almost simultaneously with the other two, falls somewhat into that category."
1144,6427,"On the one hand, the IPN report agreed ""Climate models generally predict that the temperature rises in the Arctic will substantially exceed the global rise."
1145,6429,"On the other hand, the report thinks the news might not be so bad for the North Atlantic fisheries."
1146,6430,"""The impact of global warming on fish stocks and fisheries is hard to judge,"" the IPN report said."
1147,6432,"The important commercial species that probably would benefit from warming include cod, haddock, saithe, herring, blue whiting and several types of flatfish and crustaceans -- such as the Norway lobster."
1148,6433,"Important species that probably would decline include shrimp, capelin, Greenland halibut and some varieties of flatfish."
1149,6434,Hidden in this laundry list -- and in the pile of studies examined by the Pew researchers -- is one of the fundamental chasms dividing participants in the global warming debate.
1150,6435,"The IPN report examines commercial fish species, but it neglects important non-commercial animals, such as seals and polar bears."
1151,6437,"The problem is whether one cares what happens to the polar bears, checkerspot butterflies and other unconsumables."
1152,6438,The Pew researchers tried to transcend the economic argument.
1153,6439,"They assumed a value -- unspecified -- for non-commercial species, and in doing so rendered the warming news a bit less rosy."

1162,6494,"The fact is, when I began traveling for business to New England, when I first visited my in-laws in Montana and Idaho, I was shocked at the lack of racial diversity."
1163,6499,"Some refused to leave, but so many were unable to."
1164,6503,I suspect it will not change greatly... but you never know how much stock people put in the news.
1165,6505,I expect that many of the displaced people (those affluent and those not) will remain in the places they were evacuated to.
1166,6521,What I know is that I have a close friend who's aunt disappeared in New Orleans.
1167,6523,"The family here (California) wanted to fly any family members from there to CA, so they could remain here until things got straightened out down there."
1168,6525,The hope was that anyone looking for the Aunt would see the family post and know that help was available.
1169,6528,"What I heard was the Mayor of New Orleans, saying that he didn't order the buses or anything else to be used because he was waiting on someone else to tell him what to do."

1191,6727,"""A fine comparison!"" said Sancho; ""though not so new but that I have heard it many and many a time, as well as that other one of the game of CHESS; how, so long as the game lasts, each piece has its own particular office, and when the game is finished they are all mixed, jumbled up and shaken together, and stowed away in the bag, which is much like ending life in the grave."""

1204,6763,"The Rock revolution came from the nation that allows a church to be changed to a pub or to a dance room or to a recording studio full of drug addicts, homosexuals and lunatics (as that of George Martin, ally of the Beatles)."
1205,6766,"As the epithet of the government of Satan on that nation, the center of London, the so well-known Piccadilly Circus, takes it's name from an old brothel (the ""Piccadilla House"" which means ""The House of Sin""), disappeared nowadays."

1207,6776,"John Lennon's divorce followed, as well as his entering the world of black magic, as deeply as to buy the apartment. where the ""Rosemary's baby"" had been filmed, previous property of Roman Polansky, and in that same apartment John Lennon had a room upholstered with black silk where he used to do his black magic operations."
1208,6777,"Came the disintegration of the Beatles' minds with LSD which has caused, among others, schizophrenic lyrics such as ""I am the Walrus"" and incoherent schizophrenic musical expositions like ""Revolution number 9""."
1209,6778,"At the same time, the devil acted through his other main puppets with ""Sympathy for the devil"" that was when the pact of the Rolling Stones with Satan took the life of the founder of the group, the guitarist Brian Jones (who refused to be a puppet of the devil), murdered by people sent by Mick Jagger, another assassin."
1210,6780,"Antichrist John Lennon wanted to compete with Jesus Christ, and so he grew a beard and started to make a bogus role of Christ together with Yoko Ono at the Amsterdam Hilton hotel proclaiming ""Peace"", being then when he was visited by the Canadian journalist who ridiculized and admonished him wanting to know about what Lennon meant when he wrote in the lyrics of ""The ballad of John and Yoko"": ""the way things are going, they're going to crucify me..."", The CURSE OF GOD upon John Lennon carried on with all type of miseries and distresses which made Lennon give the interview to the ""Rolling Stone"" magazine (today condensed in the ""Lennon remembers"" book) where he speaks about how bad thing were going for him blaming ""whatever is up there"" for it (referring to God)."
1211,6784,"To Paul McCartney whose company's logo was a person toying with the planets as if he was a god, and who was being very much deluded in his ego trip by the fact that he was made ""Sir"" (when in England even the road sweeper is made Sir, as long as he produces money for the nation), GOD provided cancer to the wife."
1212,6786,"At the same time McCartney was going out with Heather Mills, he used Linda's death for promotional ends, due to his waning popularity."
1213,6788,"Paul admitted that he made Linda suffer a lot, but he didn't say that it was because he felt insecure as a man due to his womanish face and effeminate manners and also because with his age his sexual power was not the same, even though it has never been much."
1214,6789,"The early days were the days of competition between Paul and his wife and John and his wife and he knew he had to compete with ugly John for the leadership of the band in front of their wives and having Yoko Ono made him aware of his lack of virility and repressed homosexuality, he grew the beard that we see in the ""Let it Be"" film and started to show pictures of naked women in the same film, doing every effort he could to be seen as a man...."
1215,6792,"Paul has such a big inferiority complex as a man, due to his effeminate face, body and personality and due to his repressed homosexuality, that he found himself a handicapped woman with only one leg, so that he could stand out, being very conscious that a full woman would make him feel the superiority of virile men again, as Jane and Linda did."
1216,6796,"Because of the trauma that his homosexual relation with Brian Epstein had left him, he made lyrics such as: ""You can wear a collar and a tie, one thing you can't hide is when you're crippled inside"" and gave declarations to the ""Rolling Stone"" magazine saying that ""sometimes he wore Texan boots to feel more secure as a man""."
1217,6799,That rejection got to the point that George Harrison kicked Yoko Ono in the Apple studios during the filming of Let it Be.
1218,6803,The Jewish marriage living to the right of George's house said that he is an arrogant person who does never return a greeting.

1224,6810,"George Harrison said in a video that ""Oasis is a very untalented band and they shouldn't be playing at all"", all of it being the truth, but the Beatles is also a band of very poor musicians, if musicians at all, who could only play a couple of elementary guitar chords and who are as untalented as Oasis."

1237,6858,The so called 'Tanker' wars in the late 1980s put Iran squarely in the bullseye of all nations seeking to transport oil out of the region.
1238,6861,"The CSIS report cites numerous areas where Iran has funded modernization including the most troublesome aspect, anti-shipping cruise missiles: 'Iran has obtained new anti-ship missiles and missile patrol craft from China, midget submarines from North Korea, submarines from Russia, and modern mines.'"""

1375,7972,"I thought that I had gained my cockatiel's trust, but now he's not coming to me when I open his cage."

1380,8021,"Yeah, I thought that the holding his mouth thing sounded wrong."
1381,8031,"Hi, I want to get a few pet rats and need a rat cage."
1382,8039,They LOVE to climb.
1383,8044,"I used one of these cages short term for a pet and it wasn't that great to be honest, pretty cheaply made, the door springs are annoying and it doesn't last very well."

1395,8154,To save money Robert McNamara ordered that the ammunition for the new M-16s being sent to SEA in the early 60s use an older (dirtier) type of gunpowder meant for use with the M-14.
1396,8157,As a result there was a problem with the weapon jamming.
1397,8162,Vietnam m16 used to clog up and never work.
1398,8164,No one uses 3 burst.
1399,8165,you play too much cod ;P

1425,8352,****sigh**** not trying to sound snooty or stuck up but I mean really!

1428,8370,"The word renaissance (Rinascimento in Italian) means “rebirth”, and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages."

1433,8412,Sussexs have soft feathers.
1434,8415,Sussex have White Skin which could be recessive or dominate.

1436,8424,Sussex have four toes.
1437,8430,I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000.
1438,8432,http://i.imgur.com/S2MD2.jpg http://i.imgur.com/T2zff.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Xytex.jpg I took some photos of my model girlfriend with my Nikon D7000 (see links above).
1439,8436,"you need to learn about white balance, composition, angle, and work on using the camera properly..."
1440,8442,"In the photo on the couch, the pillow she is resting on clashes with everything else in the shot."
1441,8444,"In the standing photo (from the front) there is a corner of a rug creeping in, some kind of box in the lower right corner and what looks like a power cord."
1442,8448,"My suggestion is to pay close attention to what's going on in the background and if possible, stand on a chair, get on the ground, do whatever you need to do to get rid of distracting elements."
1443,8459,"The only notable difference I have noticed is that in the south of Ireland one night of the wake is often held in the chapel the night before the funeral, this tradition started after the civil war."
1444,8462,"Pioneers take a pledge to remain tee-total and at the hight of the organization popularity, had an estimated two million members even filling Croke Park on the 25th anniversary."
1445,8467,"the irish customs we have in our family are; we make sinnel cake for easter ,barn brack and col-cannon for Halloween."
1446,8472,"I heard that a company (here is a link: http://news.yahoo.com/nestl-purina-releases-commercial-aimed-dogs-183443091.html ) is trying to make a dog food commercial aimed at dogs, complete with squeaky chew-toy sounds, and high pitched sounds that humans can't hear."
1447,8481,"The pictures are broadcast at a rate of about 60Hz, which is how fast they need to move for us to see them as a moving, flawless picture."
1448,8486,Yes they do.
1449,8489,"I need one horse transported to shows throughout the 2012 show season, and the location is about 3 hours away from where I live."
1450,8493,I saw a site that charges $0.70 per mile.
1451,8498,"Some people are willing to take your horse, but they really have old trailers that are not the safest in the world."
1452,8499,"Rusted, torn corners in the stalls, unhealthy air, straight load instead of slant load can all make travelling hard, if not downright dangerous, on your horse."
1453,8500,"I had my horse transported from CA to WA and he came on this big, open stock trailer."
1454,8509,I want to take a cruise around the world.
1455,8526,"yes there are multiple around the world cruises, mainly offered by the more upscale lines."
1456,8545,We had fewer social benefits at that time for people so many immigrants were not counted.
1457,8546,"Only Caucasians had any political power, corporate presence or owned businesses except for Mom and Pop stores in some neighborhoods."
1458,8547,San Francisco was settled in the 19th and 20th century by mainly European immigrants except for some Asian workers who were manual laborers.
1459,8549,We had a larger black population in the 70s than we have now but they did not have any power until Willie Brown was elected.
1460,8558,"We feed the chickens scraps of veggies and fruits throughout the day, but it's nothing that a rabbit wouldn't be able to digest just fine."
1461,8561,"My last rabbit did that a few times, and he was fine..."
1462,8566,"You said they live in different cages and they are free in day,so no problem,don't put both of them in one cage because rabbits bedding is different than that of hens,wet bedding can cause diseases in them!"
1463,8569,yea i guess but rabbits a easily escape a pen or another rabbit could get in there and that rabbit could be the opposite gender.
1464,8585,Brass has an even higher melting point than bronze and I would think your charcoal just doesn't get hot enough.
1465,8586,"I bet you also did take charcoal as it is used for barbecue which does not get as hot as real coal (e.g. for blacksmithing one needs coal, not barbecue charcoal)."
1466,8589,I melt brass and cast it http://www.mikegigi.com/castgobl.htm
1467,8590,"Brass melts at just under 2000F which is a bright yellow heat, not red hot."
1468,8593,I use propane with a blower and a burner I built http://www.mikegigi.com/meltmetl.htm and http://www.mikegigi.com/firehole.htm
1469,8601,We all enjoy buying a snack when visiting a town or attraction while on holiday.
1470,8602,Not everyone wants to bring packed lunch.

1472,8619,She has no experience with snakes and has never held one.
1473,8620,"I did all my research and am well prepared to keep one, I'm 14 by the way"
1474,8643,Just today I bought a medium rat for my beloved Ball Python Salazar (name after Harry Potter).
1475,8645,"But today, I got a boy and realized that he is HUGE!"
1476,8665,Im moving from South Carolina so this will already be a huge culture shock.
1477,8693,I have a 4 months Shih Tzu puppy.
1478,8697,"I saw lots of videos about this, but actually it didn't help."
1479,8702,"Last thing is every time I sit on a chair or something higher than him, he will try to jump on, if he can't, he will bark all the time until I let him get on, what should I do with this ?"
1480,8706,You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness.
1481,8707,This type of harness goes around the dogs chest and legs and has a clip for the leash up on the back of the dog in middle of shoulder blades.
1482,8715,"You want your dog to admire you as his pack leader, not fear you."
1483,8732,Rooms start from 500 per double.
1484,8761,"I have a hamster, and mice and rats like to escape."
1485,8771,"Mine learned to ""go to the bathroom"" only in their cages and loved to ride on my shoulder or hang out in my hoodie pouch."
1486,8772,The only downside is they should be kept in pairs or trios and require a pretty large habitat.
1487,8773,"That means expense, space, and they require weekly cage cleaning."
1488,8781,We have two.
1489,8783,You have to have two because they don't do well alone.
1490,8788,"They love leaf or romaine lettuce and tomatos, celery, cucumbers, carrots."
1491,8794,"I wanted to volunteer and help animals, and decided to try fostering kittens."
1492,8799,"I realize they are young and that cats do climb, but this is just ridiculous."
1493,8813,"But in the meantime, highly recommend jeans and long sleeves anytime you'll be interacting with the kittens."
1494,8820,I find the adults are much easier.
1495,8830,"Some places do the registration right at the hospital....in some smaller places, you need to register your child's birth at the town hall/registrar's office."
1496,8831,My first three children were born in Southern Ontario cities.
1497,8832,The birth registration was done right in hospital.
1498,8833,"My last son, was born in Northern Ontario...."
1499,8836,"I had to call the Office of the Registrar General in Thunder Bay, have copies of the delayed registration form mailed out to me, as they don't have an online area for it yet, fill those out, send them away, then apply for his birth certificate."
1500,8854,Each provincial government has a website that lists the process for that Province so depending upon where you were born you can google it.
1501,8865,Some cruise aficionados refuse to sail on one or the other.
1502,8868,For our comparison we sailed on two similar ships - the Carnival Liberty and the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas.
1503,8869,"Itinerary Both ships go to Caribbean Islands like Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Cozumel, St. Thomas, the Bahamas and St. Martin / St. Maarten."
1504,8871,The Mariner of the Seas traveled to its private island Coco Cay and Labadee (the north coast of Haiti).
1505,8872,We loved most of the locations that both of the ships visited and don't believe that this should be a distinguishing factor on deciding between the cruise lines.
1506,8873,Shows Each night there are a variety of shows.
1507,8875,We felt that the main shows on the Mariner of the Seas were better.
1508,8876,On the Liberty we liked the comedian and juggling act.
1509,8878,Dining Room We enjoyed the atmosphere of both dining rooms on the Liberty and Mariner of the Seas.
1510,8879,We felt that the menu had a little more variety on the Mariner of the Seas.
1511,8880,Friendliness of staff The Liberty and Mariner of the Seas both get high grades.
1512,8882,"We had a slightly better experience on the Liberty, but feel that both crews did an excellent job and that this should not be a distinguishing factor on choosing a cruise."
1513,8883,Pools The Mariner of the Seas and Liberty both had salt water pools - which most cruise ships have.
1514,8884,They both had pools for kids and adults.
1515,8887,Spa We tried the spa on the Liberty and loved it.
1516,8900,(I Have 1 year before collage!)
1517,8904,"I mean when I graduate & yes, college, sorry for the typo."
1518,8910,There are 2 more located outside of the main continent with Alaska way to the north and Hawaii in the Pacific.
1519,8928,"You need a lot of money for hotels, airfare, seeing the sites, food, local transport - you name it but life costs."
1520,8932,I recommend buying a single unlimited Europass and travelling anywhere in the EU your heart desires.
1521,8960,"remember to visit with him while he is in the room, and tell him how good he is."
1522,8968,"Last night, I adopted a 2 year old Male German Shepherd."
1523,8971,My other MAJOR problem is that he will not get in his crate.
1524,8979,I have a 9 month old German Shepherd that I raised from a puppy.
1525,8980,I trained her myself.
1526,8981,"She is crate trained, potty trained, and can sit, lay down, stay, come, fetch, and will even stay in a down position while I throw a treat across the floor or even right next to her paw, and she wont get it until I give her the command."
1527,8988,You have to be in command at all times.
1528,8989,There are ways to get your new dog used to the crate or going out.
1529,9016,The are located right at 248 De Than St. in the heart of the back packer district.
1530,9018,I did an overnight in a home stay that was sweet and the water market was wonderful.
1531,9034,Most of the tourists that I've come across buy tours along the My Tho waterfront.
1532,9035,"You take a boat across the river, then spend a day biking, eating at a local restaurant, buying souvenirs and doing other things that are geared towards tourists."
1533,9038,It's called Kiwi Heaven and it's across the river from Cho Ben Tre.
1534,9043,"We went with Intrepid as a part of their North to South Vietnam Trip, but they do offer this one day separately."
1535,9044,"We had a great time and visited a location where they made coconut candies, visited a local restaurant which was attached to a fish farm, rode in modified quad bikes and had some tropical food at what appeared to be a local hangout."
1536,9047,I got a riding lesson today on one of my boss's fino horses and it made me realize just how unsteady my left leg is.
1537,9048,I mentioned it to my boss and she said to start doing yoga.
1538,9049,But there are just so many poses and programs!
1539,9079,I thought it would pass until he started to vomit blood and wouldnt drink any water.
1540,9080,I took him to the Animal Hospital and they ran blood work and everything came back normal.
1541,9082,"The vet said it was gastroenteritis and gave him fluids under his skin , an injection of nausea medication along with some take home antibiotics."
1542,9106,"From there you end up with electrolyte imbalances, which can lead to heart and kidney problems."
1543,9114,You need to ask your vet these questions.
1544,9118,"My vet told me when a dog is vomiting a lot, it could be a sign of obstruction."
1545,9137,My mind thinks she has no interest in me and just stringing me along.
1546,9138,But the articles I read seemed to say the contrary.
1547,9145,"You said you liked her and she accepted it as a truth and perhaps as a compliment, but it does not mean she fancies you or wants to pair off with you."
1548,9149,Christiane gave you a good answer.
1549,9151,"What I have to add is that it is normal in France to have mixed gender groups of friends, there's nothing unusual in boys and girls being only friends, which is obviously what this girl wants from you."
1550,9159,There are no jobs in this country.
1551,9164,Everybody I know at university intends to stay at uni for as long as possible until there are actually jobs available.
1552,9165,"Everybody seems to flee this country and move overseas, to Australia, etc."
1553,9196,"At the moment there's no interest, but that'll probably change."
1554,9202,I guess I'm extremely fortunate that I received a scholarship which paid about 800f my course fees through my degree.
1555,9204,There are far too many lazy people out there who think that they can sit around a job will fall in their lap.

1865,10920,Those things ended up being a windsheild washer fluid tank (1 screw) and the air filter canister (4 spring clips).
1866,10921,I did the work myself for $50.

1894,11100,"I found her to be extremely solid, kind, compassionate, and intuitive as well."
1895,11106,The decor left a lot to be desired and the posters telling me all the reasons 99 was great just served as an ironic contrast against the reality.
1896,11109,I explained to him what I wanted and that I previously went to Braman Honda.

1906,11140,I think he could've done more to assuage my concerns by giving me concrete facts.

2056,11806,"I took the weekend off and came in and asked for the manager who is Jeff and he remembered her right away even remembered her dog, I was a bit shocked that someone would pay that close attention."
2057,11808,I thouhgt it would be out of my price range but they really worked with me and now I couldnt be happier.
2058,11822,One suspects that earlier reviewer works for another laundry.
2059,11824,"Yes, there are bigger, but bigger isn't necessarily better."
2060,11832,We have to leave him at the vet for 3 days and I was told to call for check ups as often as I wished that no matter how many times I called I would not annoy them.
2061,11833,lol They where super friendly towards us and treated us like people not walking bags of cash.
2062,11842,I think they're still in the mindset from when it was only smokers sitting around and drinking... not in any hurry.
2063,11853,I look at some of these other comments & laugh because people think that the world revolves around them!
2064,11855,Midas has the most high tech equipment in town & I guarantee you if they told you it was electrical then in deed its electrical!
2065,11863,The bottom line is that the food isn't great and is relatively high-priced.
2066,11868,I was booked for 2 nights at this hotel in Oct 2007.
2067,11869,"At 3:15 am on night #2, the fire alarm and strobe light activated in my room."
2068,11872,I called the front desk and got no answer.
2069,11876,"This little drip offered no apologies whatsoever, and even refused to give me the name of the manager until I pressed him for it 3 times."
2070,11880,"I began seeing Dr. Romanick back in 2000 and have seen a significant decline in the quality of care, patient-doctor communication, and just the overall level of services."
2071,11881,"The poor quality starts at the receptionist desk, where the staff is very impatient and lack the efficiency I once loved about the office."
2072,11896,You have to pay CASH ONLY before they start unloading track on your destination.
2073,11907,"He was referred to me by a friend, who didn't have the best experience with Ted, but said that Ted was able to make up for his lack of preparedness at the end."
2074,11908,I figure I would give this company a chance.
2075,11911,"He brought fabric books, and pictures of furniture only, which all came way over budget."
2076,11929,"He responded ""we have problem with 'people'""."
2077,11932,He said he's had a long and bad day.
2078,11933,We had no choice but to stay but will take this as far as we can.
2079,11935,I came to find out the person was the hotel OWNER also.
2080,11936,"My friend and I were to stay here for a girls night, catch up on our lives evening."
2081,11937,We live within 20 miles of the hotel and wanted to get away from our responsibilities for the night.
2082,11940,They said that we were to be charged for this room regardless because we did not cancel within the 72 hours.
2083,11944,"I emailed 4 times, never a response."
2084,11945,"In one of the emails I attached the letter from the Vet's that expressed their sympathy, this hotel did nothing."
2085,11950,I thought the UK was completely devoid of good NYC style pizza.
2086,11951,"I thought to get a decent pizza the only way was at a fancy restaurant, and I have to get a whole pie."
2087,11952,I thought I would have to wait until I went home to NYC.
2088,11954,I saw this place and it looked like the HOLY GRAIL.
2089,11955,"I knew I had found the real deal, big pies, sold by the slice, with the pizzas sitting under the glass in the front."
2090,11956,They have crushed red pepper flakes and oregano.
2091,11964,We visited on 7/26/08 for dinner We received a gift certificate for the Mama Mia's on Greenfield Ave.
2092,11970,Sorry for interrupting I guess.
2093,11972,There were no other options available (I only brought my check card to cover any overage cost) and she rang it up and applied it to the gift card before telling me about the tip policy.
2094,11974,There are other places with food just as good with management that values customers and employees much more.
2095,11976,"TEXAS ROADHOUSE HAS VERY GOOD MEALS, THAT THE MEAT COMES RIGHT OFF THE BONES."
2096,11977,IT HAS VERY GOOD PRICES.
2097,11982,I HAD TO ASK THE GIRL WHO BROUGHT MY FOOD AND SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO LET ME KNOW.
2098,11983,I HAD TO WAIT FOR MY WAITRESS.
2099,11987,"THE MANAGER CAME OVER AND SAID HE WAS SORRY AND GAVE A NEW BATCH OF WINGS, HE SAID WE CANT REALLY DO ANYTHING BECAUSE THE DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPENING AND CLOSING ."
2100,11989,BUT EVERYONE HAS THERE OWN WAY!!!!!!
2101,11998,they do that whole thing where you sandwich the pepperoni between layers of cheese for +32 delicious.
2102,12000,it runs you about 4 bucks and it deals crushing blows to hunger.
2103,12008,He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive.
2104,12009,I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade-in and the price of the 09 XF.
2105,12010,The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes.
2106,12018,Myself and my fiance's identity was stolen from the office staff.
2107,12019,We were told by a detective and asked to check our credit for anything unusual.
2108,12022,She stole the information and gave it to another guy that did all the work.
2109,12024,Thats how they were caught.
2110,12025,They both went to jail and a new manager was put in charge of the apartments.
2111,12026,The apartment across from mine belonged to a gang of hookers.
2112,12031,I lived in one that did not face the parking lot.
2113,12035,Gates worked 30% of the time at best.
2114,12041,"They tracked down the only tire that fit my BMW330i in Murfreesboro within minutes and secured it, then they came out, took off my tire (it was a runflat - but runflats don't do you any good if they blow out), and brought it to their shop to change the tire."
2115,12045,I hope I can return the favor in the future!
2116,12051,"I chose the later, but approached the front desk about the hotel policy to push over their responsibilities on local authorities, not to mention the good nights sleep i paid for but didnt get."
2117,12052,I was told management would call me back but still waiting for that call.
2118,12055,"He preceded to grab the slice off the countertop and throw it into the trash while yelling at me saying, ""you do not order what you do not know about"" and ""you don't know how pizza is made""."
2119,12059,"I think he did it on purpose because of my simple request for another slice of grandma that wasn't so well-done (actually, burnt)."
2120,12064,The first thing you notice when you arrive on location is that the waiting line literally goes out the door and spills into the parking lot.
2121,12066,"I mean, that's the way it works at amusement parks: the longest lines are at the best rides."
2122,12073,I suggest you go up to Raging Taco & Raging Burrito a couple of blocks up the street or even Taco Mac.
2123,12075,"We were introduced to Bistro Tallulah by traveler-professional diner who happens to own the Adelphi Hotel and travels the world-- and residing in Paris,London, New York the rest of the year."
2124,12076,SHE KNOWS GREAT FOOD AND DINING EXPERIENCES.
2125,12080,This chef knows what he is doing.
2126,12083,The affordable rent makes it possible for an inspired chef to serve his high quality fare at affordable prices!
2127,12088,I think that there pretty good.
2128,12091,I feel that the way some doctors offices work around here is a little bit absurd so I'm happy that these guys don't do those two things in particlular.
2129,12102,I work for a large retail company recently expanding our operations into Canada and had to travel to ensure all of our computer network equipment was installed properly and on time.
2130,12105,"I found the hotel to be amazingly clean, not to mention very well adorned with many pleasant surprises."
2131,12106,From my first encounter at check in to my regrettable check out I found the staff and facility to exceed my expectation.
2132,12112,Update: I had to add to my review.
2133,12115,I frequent this resturant on a weekly basis but usally only for lunch.
2134,12120,I had the Chicken Parmesan Dinner and my wife had the Shrimp Scampi Dinner.
2135,12123,I have to say the value of this place always amazes me.
2136,12125,Bottom line is that when it's a small privatly owned resturant like this is you can tell that the owners and employees take pride in their product and service.
2137,12132,He checked out what I needed to have done told me what needed be fixed before he did any work and did great repair work.
2138,12136,"I grew up in a small town where you knew and trusted your mechanic and was really cynical about city auto repair shops since I moved here, but Phet has shown that there really are honest hard working mechanics around."
2139,12140,We made the decision for a couple of reasons.
2140,12152,The intruders slit the screen of the window.
2141,12155,"My next-door neighbor heard the noise and turned on a light, thankfully scaring the two miscreants away (they even left their hammer behind!)."
2142,12157,"Lo and behold, they replaced the screen (which had to be ordered) yesterday and didn't charge me a dime."
2143,12163,We were booked at the Sheraton with a number of other out-of-town wedding guests.
2144,12166,"There were 3 adults in our room but towels for only 2, no linens for sofa bed."
2145,12168,A package and some wedding cards were left in our first room.
2146,12169,"They were sent to our second room and had been opened--the ribbon-wrapped present, and all 3 envelopes."
2147,12170,"Security in the hotel seemed to be excellent, but we were never given an explanation as to why someone would open these items."
2148,12175,I think this place is probably really great especially judging by the reviews on here.
2149,12182,I played dumb and asked him questions that I already knew the answers to and he responded with half truths and a few falsehoods.
2150,12183,"For instance I asked who owned Mazda and he said with confidence that was GM, which isn't true."
2151,12184,"I mean, I don't care if he doesn't know, but if he pretends to know and tells me BS to my face, there's no way I'm going to trust him when matters turn to the price of the car and financing."
2152,12187,The service stunk.
2153,12188,"I called in my order and upon arriving to pick it up, they got my order confused with someone elses."
2154,12191,She asked for the dinner combo and they gave her two dinner plates instead.
2155,12195,We had to throw out about 80 percent of our meals because the food tasted so horrible.
2156,12217,I dropped off a sheet metal piece that I needed copied due to th it was needing to be replaced.
2157,12219,They said it would be made exactly like the one I needed to replace.
2158,12222,I took the original piece of metal and rigged it to make due since I had to complete the job.
2159,12223,I took the receipt and the metal that did not fit and asked Pomper for my money back.
2160,12225,She told me she could not use the piece I was returning and the company would only put it in the trash so I could not return it.
2161,12226,I explained I did not get what I paid for.
2162,12227,She asked me to bring the original piece back and I told her I had to use it on the job.
2163,12228,She told me that was to bad she would do nothing to help me since she could not use or resell the piece.
2164,12229,I said I was going to trash it also and could I at least have a credit.
2165,12230,With a smirk on her face she told me NO MONEY IS BEING RETURNED and THAT IS THE WAY IT WAS.
2166,12232,There are to many people that need our business to have to put up with this unfair treatment!!!!!
2167,12235,I signed up with one of the staff who was very pleasant and professional.
2168,12238,They need to update the locker rooms ASAP.
2169,12247,There are better places on the Cape - FITNESS 500!
2170,12249,I feel obligated to share this story.
2171,12250,Right out of college I called the salon and explained my situation.
2172,12253,I had this ridiculous celebrity stylist from LA named Derrick.
2173,12256,I wanted to be very blonde and instead he pulled my root color throughout my whole hair which is a gross mousey brown.
2174,12257,"The other stylists around me kept pressuring me saying he's so wonderful, you're going to love your hair."
2175,12259,"Derrick did a terrible job, was a complete jerk the entire time, and I had no warning as to the price."
2176,12274,"I expected to pay for this service, but imagine my surprise when I received a bill for MORE than what I paid to have the original return prepared."
2177,12280,He said yes.
2178,12283,"In the words of my new accountant, THEY LET ME DOWN!"
2179,12285,I bought about half of the furniture I own from this place.
2180,12297,I waited.
2181,12301,He kept saying different arrival/delivery dates and didn't seem terribly apologetic.
2182,12303,"Point is: You might be able to get a good deal on some nice furniture -- which I did -- but they're not very communicative and god forbid something goes wrong, you'll have to fight to get it resolved."
2183,12308,"On August 21st, 2009 I ordered furniture from Hickory Furniture Mart and contracted for HDS to deliver it."
2184,12309,After seventeen days the delivery van showed up at my home minus two pieces.
2185,12312,"I spent $2300 on the bedroom suite, which was complete and excellent condition on the showroom floor."
2186,12318,I hope the owners and employees of this store have broken bedroom suites in their homes and furniture sitting in someone's warehouse.
2187,12326,I had to cancel my initial lesson 4 times and on the 5th attempt the management was quick enough to associate my cancellations with my fear and finally encouraged me into taking my initial lesson.
2188,12327,"Five minutes before my initial lesson, I got a call from Gerry advising me of his arrival and to come down as soon as I was ready."
2189,12331,I trust you and believe that you'll be able to handle this and all you have to do is to reciprocate!
2190,12345,They have the best Egg Drop Soup I have ever tasted.
2191,12364,"I had a surgery date of July 17, 2008."
2192,12375,"Even my PA i went to the other day said ""it must by comforting to have gone to a heart surgeon like him who will do nothing for you""."
2193,12386,"You say you work a lot, and that you have a young dog; so I have little doubt that your dog is just filled with energy to burn; and it is good of you to look for a place to take him."
2194,12393,"I called dominos tonight, it rang forever, I get put on hold twice without saying a word and FINALLY someone says, MAY I HELP YOU?"
2195,12395,"They say no, Warwick in New Jersey, Call New Jersey."
2196,12396,"I laugh and say, no, that Warwick is in New York, but I'm at the Radison-Warwick."
2197,12398,"and I said, YES, CENTER CITY PHILLY, and he says, NO, Warwick is a township, If you're at a Radison in Warwick thats too far, try dominos in Pottstown."
2198,12399,"I say, NO, I am at the RADISON WARWICK HOTEL in Rittenhouse Square."
2199,12400,"He says: I not know that town, I have to get to work, I'm in PHILLY."
2200,12403,"He says, I have to have an exact ADDRESS."
2201,12404,"OK, 1701 LOCUST STREET i say."
2202,12408,"Yes, I say."
2203,12412,"She says, Is that 17th like over past broad."
2204,12416,"Anyway, after much yelling and cussing I hung up, grabbed a cab, and went to Geno's."
2205,12421,Within a week we noticed one of the boards on our gate splitting where a nail had gone in.
2206,12422,We called our representative who assured me he would call the office and have it taken care of.
2207,12423,We heard nothing.
2208,12433,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!
2209,12437,"I called the ""207"" number and listened to the same recording loop 3 times before I gave up."
2210,12439,"They had a room with a $99 rate, which I booked."
2211,12447,"We returned after 3PM, found no one there, and a note from the innkeeper with directions to our room."
2212,12458,All these rules are posted in the rooms.)
2213,12460,I put the coffee thing in hot water and settled for a cup of weak coffee.
2214,12465,"The Inn touts a shower with dual shower heads, but only one worked."
2215,12471,"The worst thing that can happen for any restaurant like Zahav is to have too many people write hyperbolic reviews making claims that ""everyone"" is going to ""love"" the food, decor and service."
2216,12472,"The truth is, in my and my dining partners' experience, this is a fine little restaurant with some unique food."
2217,12482,"Dessert was... hmmm, that's interesting, I don't even remember dessert."
2218,12483,I guess that tells you a lot.
2219,12496,I thought it would be a good idea to see how a few that I liked would look like on a model (by looking the dress up online).
2220,12498,"They said they were ""unable to tell me until they ordered my dress""."
2221,12512,Other shops around this city have MUCH NICER and more TRANSPARENT owners.
2222,12527,"I got the order completed, and then questioned the technician since it came out about $40 less than I expected."
2223,12528,"He said it was the same tire, and verified this, after checking both the actual tire on my car and my service papers from earlier in the week."
2224,12533,"They promised it'd be done within an hour, so I waited in the lobby."
2225,12540,On Monday I called and again it was a big to-do to find anyone who knew anything about it.
